# Nelson Writes (Just a Blog!)

Welcome to my personal blog website! 
I created this simple website using Gatsby and GraphQL, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## About

As someone who loves writing, I wanted to create a space where I could not only share my thoughts but also have a place that inspires me to write even more.

Building this website was an exciting journey, and I enjoyed learning new things along the way. From setting up the project to figuring out how to manage content dynamically, this has been a great experience.

## Why I Created This

I believe that having a personal blog can be a powerful tool for self-expression and reflection. 
This website is my way of keeping track of my ideas, thoughts, and experiences, while also having fun with technology.  
It also serves as a way to continue learning and improving my skills as I create more posts.

Happy reading and writing! ✍️
