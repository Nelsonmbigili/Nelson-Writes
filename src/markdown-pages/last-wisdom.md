In a room where communication is forbidden, a wisdom tooth appears at the twilight of her existence, carrying untold emotions and a mysterious past. Her final message reminds her companions of the unseen power of kindness, communication, and shared destiny.

The wisdom tooth appeared with nothing but tears of joy flowing down her face. Seated at the back left corner of the room and as the last of her kind, she was immensely grateful that she at least made it out. Everyone in the room understood the strong emotions her cry carried—but what emotions exactly? None of them could tell. Where had she been for all the years? What had she come for? And what exactly was she communicating? While everyone in the room craved answers, communication among themselves was forbidden.

Those close to her mockingly thought that she must have had a glorious life, believing she was not at all used to manual tasks. Recalling the old tales she once heard about how those of her kind attended to the toughest challenges in the room, she couldn't imagine her closest neighbors thinking that way. 

The minority—the middle group—and the rudest of them all, imagined nothing but her execution. *Why do we have to keep her with us? Of what use is she?* Meanwhile, those seated at the front had another view. They imagined that this was simply how the "last borns" behaved, confidently firm in their opinion, having lived the longest in the room.

Somehow, she began admitting that she was probably useless in this new world. But how could she even learn of her roommates' thoughts? Perhaps that is why she was named *wise*.

Her excitement was short-lived as disappointment set in. The truth she certainly knew was that she never had a life before that. Then where did she hear the stories? How did she learn of those like her? What surprised her most was how certain she was of those stories—so certain she carried them as her only hope for surviving in that unfriendly room. 

Her life was spared for a short while before her execution, and it was then that her final letter, hidden beneath her seat, was found.

With a bold title, it read:

## *"You Might Want to Read This"*

> "I hope you find this some days after I am already gone.  
> I sincerely convey my appreciation for the time we spent together.  
> Living as strangers, we still faithfully served the same master.  
> 
> I am writing this letter to let you know a few things:
> 
> Firstly, it has always been you that I looked at, but sadly you ignored that responsibility.  
> All day long you thought only, 'Of what use is that backbencher?'  
> Please do not attempt another murder—may I be the last in your cure.  
> Be kind and welcoming; millions of lives depend on you.  
> Who knows? I might one day have ground the toughest of nuts to cure a fatal disease.
> 
> Secondly, after I am gone, it is not time to regret your ways, but to embrace what will keep you stronger now, because only that will sustain you.
> 
> Thirdly, be selfless.  
> While the favors came, you took them all for yourself.  
> I was stuck black, sometimes grey, always forgotten.  
> No wonder my life went astray.
> 
> Lastly, but not least—communication is power!  
> While you kept your thoughts about what a stranger I was and where I was from, you did not share them.  
> Please speak up next time. That was another weapon you used to take me down.
> 
> And to you, of my kind, sprouting out at the back right corner:  
> Don't wait to write at your deathbed.  
> Make sure you speak.  
> Let all that troubles you be known.  
> No rule rules—speak out even when forbidden, so long as you must."
