Paris is truly pure magic. Every street, every café, and every sunset felt like a dream. I spent my days wandering through beautiful neighborhoods, admiring the architecture, and soaking in the lively atmosphere. The city's beauty is in the small details — the way the light touches the old buildings, the music floating through the air, and the smell of fresh bread each morning.

Here are some moments I captured:

A place where stone and elegance meet, where each building tells stories of time, and every arch and spire stands as a testament to beauty crafted through ages.
